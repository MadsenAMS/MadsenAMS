## About Me

I've been fiddling with programming for a long time now as a hobby, and recently decided to jump head-first into programming.

I started some 10 years ago in college with a VERY basic <a href="https://github.com/MadsenAMS/cogvila">html project</a> for the lab where I was an intern, and where I also had my first contact with Batch Scripts (the lab had some very old machines that relied heavily on them).

I later messed a bit with html/css/js, and I still have a couple of my early JS codes, a minimalistic <a href="https://github.com/MadsenAMS/Javascript-Dice-Roll">dice-roller</a> for RPG sessions and later a small engine to <a href = "https://github.com/MadsenAMS/Encrypt-Decrypt-HTML-Javascript-CSS">encrypt and decrypt</a> stuff with a lib I found on the net. 

I unfortunately kept very little of the first serious project I worked on, a php/html/css/js/mysql project of a site that would mine test questions from a question bank to build quick simulated tests for high-school teachers upon selected subjects. The site was full with news-feed and e-mail engines before the team broke up and gave up on the project. 

Since then I've worked with a couple of designers (<a href = "https://www.zencapybara.com">the ZenCapybara team</a>) in a small <a href="https://github.com/ZenCapybara/MidasBankClerk">game project</a> using Unity and C#. The project is still ongoing, and might be ready for beta testing early next year. 

I've been dedicating most of my free time studying C# and NodeJS (a long with their xUnit and Jest unit testing) in hopes of landing a job as a programmer.
